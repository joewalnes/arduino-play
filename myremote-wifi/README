Arduino program for http://www.cutedigi.com/product_info.php?products_id=4363
that connects to my WiFi router, starts a web server, listens for requests
and sends the appropriate IR commands to get my AV equipment into the right
state (e.g. switching inputs, turning things on/off, etc). Remembers the state
of the world.

I use it like this: http://mainroom/dvd (do whatever needs to be done so that
I'm now ready to watch a DVD - turn TV on, set to right input, turn amp on,
set that to right input, turn everything else off).

To build, you need to copy wifi-settings-sample.h to wifi-settings.h and stick
the correct settings in.

Connect IR LED to Arduino:
 + leg to digital pin 3
 - leg to 100ohm resistor
 other end of resistor to 3.3V terminal

rooms/MainRoom.cpp contains the recipies (state transitions) for performing an activity.

equipment/ contains remote codes.

app.cpp is the main app. It starts a web server and maps requests to the appropriate activity.
